I had a class that ends at 4 today, so I was able to do it after 4.

It took three and half hours.

I was not sure of what kind of the data form they would use for Roman numbers, so I just decided to build algorithm that recieve the data from user by typing.

This program will convert numbers one by one, and they get to choose if they want to convert Roman numbers to normal numbers or normal numbers to Roman numbers.

Since it involves converting numbers, I thought the recursive method would be a good method to use.

I learned about the Object-Oriented method, so I wanted to imply this method to this challenge.

It was hard for me to understand the system of the Roman numbers, because I was not used to it.

I decided to have two dictionaries due to the process of the algorithm that I decided to use and the system of the Roman numbers.

When this program runs, it converts Roman numbers to decimal numbers and decimal numbers back to Roman numbers to check their accuracy.

I was going to add the code that creates a new file and save all the unmatched results in the file.
