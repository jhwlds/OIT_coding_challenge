It took three and half hours.

I was not sure of what kind of the data form they would use, so I just decided to build basic algorithm. 
This program will convert numbers one by one, and they get to choose if they want to convert Roman numbers to normal numbers or normal numbers to Roman numbers.

It was hard for me to understand the system of the Roman numbers, because I was not used to it.
I decided to have two dictionaries due to the process of the algorithm that I decided to use and the system of the Roman numbers.

When this program runs, it converts Roman numbers to decimal numbers and decimal numbers back to Roman numbers to check their accuracy.
